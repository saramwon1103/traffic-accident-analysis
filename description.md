# Traffic Accident Analysis with Graph Neural Networks  

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By transforming accident records into graph structures, we can uncover hidden patterns and relationships that contribute to traffic incidents.  

## üöÄ Project Objectives  
- **Preprocessing Data**: Encode categorical features and prepare the dataset.  
- **Graph Construction**: Convert accident data into a graph format using NetworkX or DGL.  
- **Model Training**: Train a GAT (Graph Attention Network) model using PyTorch Geometric.  
- **Evaluation & Prediction**: Assess model performance and predict accident causes.  
- **Interpretability**: Use attention scores to identify key risk factors.  
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive graphs to explore accident relationships.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- `data/`: Raw and processed accident data.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.  
- `src/`: Core scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `models/`: Trained models and configurations.  
- `docs/`: Project documentation and reports.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- PyTorch Geometric (GATConv)  
- NetworkX / DGL (Graph processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
